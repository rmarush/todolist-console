C# encompasses static typing,[16]: 4  strong typing, lexically scoped, imperative, declarative, functional, generic,[16]: 22  object-oriented (class-based), and component-oriented programming disciplines.[17]","Date":"2023-10-31T10:41:52.360433+02:00"},"1287234441":{"Title":"Java","Description":"Java s a high-level, class-based, object-oriented programming language that is designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible. It is a general-purpose programming language intended to let programmers write once, run anywhere (WORA),[16] meaning that compiled Java code can run on all platforms that support Java without the need to recompile.[17] Java applications are typically compiled to bytecode that can run on any Java virtual machine (JVM) regardless of the underlying computer architecture. The syntax of Java is similar to C and C\u002B\u002B, but has fewer low-level facilities than either of them. The Java runtime provides dynamic capabilities (such as reflection and runtime code modification) that are typically not available in traditional compiled languages.","Date":"2023-10-31T10:43:49.5282295+02:00"},"350383319":{"Title":"C","Description":"C is a general-purpose computer programming language. It was created in the 1970s by Dennis Ritchie, and remains very widely used and influential. By design, C\u0027s features cleanly reflect the capabilities of the targeted CPUs. It has found lasting use in operating systems, device drivers, and protocol stacks, but its use in application software has been decreasing.[7] C is commonly used on computer architectures that range from the largest supercomputers to the smallest microcontrollers and embedded systems.","Date":"2023-10-31T10:42:42.1521705+02:00"}}
